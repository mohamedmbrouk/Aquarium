Nasa Space App
##Thank you, NASA Sapce App, for this unique and different experience.
The challenge was enjoyable and pleasant, even though we couldn't achieve a top-ten ranking. However, we were able to create a mobile app called 'Aquarium' with six main features:

1- Community
2- Algae
3- Utilizing three AI models
4- A game designed to help children use the app
5- News about the Ocean
6- Ocean News

Soon, I will publish details about the application and the models I used in the app, employing computer vision technology. 
lastly, i would like to thx my team
